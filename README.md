## **Features**
- **AI-Powered Image Generation**:
  - Creates Claude Monet-inspired impressionist paintings using modern AI models.
  - Incorporates blockchain elements like liquidity grids, token motifs, and crypto market dynamics.
- **Automated Twitter Integration**:
  - Dynamically generates captions based on project themes.
  - Posts generated artwork to Twitter, sharing the beauty of the project with a global audience.
- **JSON-Based Configurations**:
  - Uses a structured JSON concept to define artistic traits, project mission, and style guidelines.

## **How It Works**
1. **Concept Definition**:
   - The `concept` JSON defines the project’s identity, style, and purpose, including:
     - Name and description.
     - Mission and scope.
     - Artistic inspirations and crypto integrations.
2. **Image Generation**:
   - Prompts are dynamically constructed using JSON data.
   - Images are generated using an AI-based image generation API.
3. **Social Media Posting**:
   - The generated image is paired with a caption derived from the JSON structure.
   - The final post is shared automatically on Twitter.

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Twitter API Access**:
   - Set up a Twitter Developer Account and generate your `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_secret`.
2. **Image Generation API**:
   - Use an AI model like DALL-E or an alternative capable of generating Monet-style art.
   - Obtain API credentials for the image generation service.
3. **Python Environment**:
   - Install required libraries:  
     ```bash
     pip install tweepy requests pillow
     ```
